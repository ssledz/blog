<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I am Scala/Haskell enthusiast living in Poland and this website serves as my
personal blog. In the past, I used to write blog entries on a different
platform, but going forward, all of my latest articles will be published
exclusively on this site. If you are curious about my previous blog, you can
find the link <a target="blank" href="https://ssledz.github.io">here</a>.
